# Alpaca MCP Server

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for trading stocks, checking positions, fetching market data, and managing your account with Alpaca.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Market Data** - Get real-time stock quotes and historical price data.
- ðŸ’µ **Account Information** - Check your balances, buying power, and status.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Position Management** - View current positions and their performance.
- ðŸ›’ **Order Placement** - Place market and limit orders through natural language.
- ðŸ“‹ **Order Management** - List, track, and cancel orders.
- ðŸ’¸ **Automated Profit-Taking** - Take partial profits when positions reach a certain threshold.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for environment and package management)
- Alpaca API keys
- An MCP client (e.g., Claude for Desktop)

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/embeddednature/alpaca-mcp-server.git
    cd alpaca-mcp-server
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Alpaca API credentials:
    ```
    API_KEY_ID="your_paper_api_key_id"
    API_SECRET_KEY="your_paper_api_secret_key"
    ```

## Usage

### Running the server

Start the server from your terminal:

```bash
uv run alpaca_mcp_server.py
```

The server will start and listen for connections from your MCP client.

### Development and Inspection

To run the server in development mode with the MCP Inspector, which allows you to view available tools and their schemas interactively, use the `dev` command:

```bash
uv run mcp dev alpaca_mcp_server.py
```

This will start the server and provide a URL to access the web-based inspector.

### Configuring with an MCP Client

To connect the server to a client like Claude for Desktop, you need to tell the client how to run the server.

1.  Open your MCP client's configuration.
2.  Add a new server configuration. The command should execute `uv` in the repository's directory to run the server script.

Here is an example for `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/uv/executable",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**:
- Make sure to replace the paths for `command` and `cwd` with the correct absolute paths on your system.
- The server loads API keys from the `.env` file, so you don't need to add them to the client configuration.

## Available Tools

The server exposes the following tools for use with your MCP client:

- `ping()` - Test if the server is responsive.
- `get_account_info()` - Get account balances and status.
- `get_positions()` - List all current positions in the portfolio.
- `get_stock_quote(symbol)` - Get the latest quote for a stock.
- `get_stock_bars(symbol, days)` - Get historical price bars for a stock.
- `get_orders(status, limit)` - List orders with a specified status.
- `place_market_order(symbol, side, quantity)` - Place a market order.
- `place_limit_order(symbol, side, quantity, limit_price)` - Place a limit order.
- `cancel_all_orders()` - Cancel all open orders.
- `close_all_positions(cancel_orders)` - Close all open positions.
- `take_partial_profit(symbol, profit_threshold, close_percentage)` - Sell a percentage of a position if profit exceeds a threshold.

## Example Queries

Once the server is connected, you can use natural language to manage your trading account:

- "Can you ping the Alpaca server?"
- "What's my current account balance and buying power?"
- "Show me my current positions."
- "Get the latest quote for AAPL."
- "Show me the price history for TSLA over the last 10 days."
- "Buy 5 shares of MSFT at market price."
- "Sell 10 shares of AMZN with a limit price of $130."
- "If my NVDA position is up by more than 25%, sell half of it."
- "Cancel all my open orders."
