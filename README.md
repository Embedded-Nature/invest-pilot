```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for environment and package management)
- Alpaca API keys
- An MCP client (e.g., Claude for Desktop)

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Embedded-Nature/invest-pilot.git
    cd invest-pilot
    ```

2.  Create a virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

3.  Set up your environment variables:
    ```bash
    # Create .env file or set environment variables directly
    export ALPACA_API_KEY="your_paper_api_key_id"
    export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your_paper_api_secret_key"
    export ALPACA_PAPER="true"  # Set to "false" for live trading
    export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"     # Optional: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
    ```

## 🎯 Usage

### Running the Server

**For production use (direct server):**
```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

**For development and testing (with MCP Inspector):**
```bash
uv run mcp dev src/main.py
```

The inspector runs at `http://localhost:6274` and provides a web interface to test all tools interactively. Look for the URL with the pre-filled authentication token in the terminal output.

### Configuring with an MCP Client

To connect the server to a client like Claude for Desktop:

**Example `claude_desktop_config.json`:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "invest-pilot": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/uv/executable",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "src/main.py"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/invest-pilot",
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_paper_api_key_id",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_paper_api_secret_key",
        "ALPACA_PAPER": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace paths with absolute paths on your system. You can set environment variables either in the config or in a `.env` file.

## 🧪 Development

### Architecture Benefits

The modular architecture provides:
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new brokers or tools
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Isolated components for unit testing
- **Scalability**: Plugin-based design for future features

### Adding New Tools

1. Create tool handlers in appropriate modules under `src/brokers/alpaca/tools/`
2. Add tool decorators in `src/main.py`
3. Update documentation
